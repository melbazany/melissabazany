  "I started creating websites as an intern for a west-Michigan based agency while I was studying at Hope College. The blend of digital design and strategic puzzle-building drew me into web development. I focus on building semantic, accessible, and, of course, responsive CMS-based websites, as my initial love was based in front-end development, but I am also experienced in DNS management and hosting and SEO strategy. My incredible team at <a href='https://mightyinthemidwest.com' rel='external noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>Mighty</a> has allowed me to build digital identities for companies such as Altus, Inc., Mill Steel, and Evergreen Commons.",
  "Simultaneously, while I was nerding out over code, I started taking photos for friends in college. I owned a camera that was a step up from an iPhone, and enjoyed capturing special moments in time for those near and dear to me. After a few innocent Facebook posts showcasing my photography, my inbox was flooded with inquiries about shooting engagements, weddings, and more.",
  "With over 50 weddings under my belt, I have grown an innocent hobby into an endeavor that isn't a business, but instead, a genuine pursuit of encapsulating emotions and memories through images."
