  "I started creating websites as an intern for a west-Michigan based agency while I was studying at Hope College. The blend of digital design and strategic puzzle-building drew me into web development. I focus on building semantic, accessible, responsive CMS-based websites, as my initial love was based in front-end development, but I am also experienced in DNS management and hosting, as well as SEO strategies to make websites seen. My incredible team at Mighty in the Midwest has allowed me to build digital identities for companies such as Altus, Inc., Mill Steel, and Evergreen Commons.",
  "Simultaneously, while I was nerding out over code, I started taking photos for friends in college, since I owned a camera that was a step up from an iPhone, and enjoyed capturing special moments in time for those near and dear to me. After a few innocent Facebook posts showcasing my photography, my inbox was flooded with inquiries about shooting engagements, weddings, and more. With over 50 weddings under my belt, I have grown a business thatâ€™s sole purpose is to encapsulate authentic emotions and eternal memories through my lens."
